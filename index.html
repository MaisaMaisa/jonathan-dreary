        <ul>
            <li>To capture the core/essence of psyche’s alienation caused by the digital realm, usage of internet, technologies in general(?).</li>

            <li>Abolish the internet, all technologies(?)</li>
            <li>Encourage the readers to form a contemporary Zapatista movement(replica also fine) while completely offline. We need to get back to our senses of and in the physical.</li>

        SCORCH = <br>

        <i>(from English)</i> to burn a surface to burn a surface to the point that its color and texture are singed and shrivelled<br>
        <i>(Since I’m a non-native English speaker)</i> SHRIVEL = wither, burn, dwindle shrink<br><br>
        
        Scorched Earth is the state of the world in our current present: no color, no singularity that gives life a meaning; it’s a state without hope that the world can be healed…Why is that? Because the youth has been captured and disempowered. It’s too late!<br><br>

                “The transformation of the internet from a network used for several decades mainly by military and research institutions into universally available online services in the mid-1990s did not happen simply because of advances in systems engineering. Rather, the shift occurred as an essential part of the massive reorganization of capital flows and the remaking of individuals into “entrepreneurs of their human capital.” The widespread introduction of informal, flexible, and decentralized forms of labor were noted by many, but in the early 1980s a smaller numb..”

            <div class="quote">
                “As heat energy diffuses throughout the biosphere to life-extinguishing levels, it’s important to state the obvious: these minerals must stay in the ground and the urgent task is the radical scaling down of a need for unlimited 24/7 energy and for all the unnecessary, disposable products and services that warp our lives and poison the earth. One of the defining currents of Western thought is an objectification of nature that cuts us off from our inherence in the limitless creativity and variability of the physical world.”
            </div>
            <div class="quote">
                “It is a parched earth deprived of water, its rivers and aquifers poisoned, air polluted and soils afflicted by drought and chemical agriculture. Scorched earth capitalism destroys whatever allows groups and communities to pursue modes of self- sufficient subsistence, of self-governance or of mutual support. This occurs with extreme violence in the Global South where extraction, deforestation, and toxic dumping  create uninhabitable wastelands, and cities in which the poor become desperate, internal exiles. ”
            </div>

            All to be followed by a catastrophe. The big event.<br>

            He writes about the internet being the tool of capitalism to destroy our lives. <br>
            We have to work all the time in order to stay connected.<br>
            It’s the internet complex.<br>
            He hopeless. A lot of hopeless remarks but leading nowhere. <br>
            He particularly hates usage of internet in schools. <br><br>

            He describes internet as some sort of a cage where we are given more than we want and we end up wanting it. I agree with this to some extent, but I also think he fails to see it as just a more expanded field of desires where desires can be experimented with. Internet definitely gave us more senses and expanded perceptions (self-awareness as the leading one), but we should not discredit the zillion users who are bored of platforms and are able to customise the use the internet according to their needs. <br><br>

            For example, with just one simple line:

            <div class="quote">
                “Within this historically unprecedented reality, any goals or ends we pursue cease to be ones we have truly chosen.” 
            </div>

            he gives me a feeling that there is one absolute truth behind our choices. If anything, I’m glad that internet made making choices a bit lighter of an experience than it was for my parents for example. Of course, abundance can be ‘stupefying’ but it doesn’t always end there. Why not have a stupefying experience/phase in life? Isn’t it great we can choose endlessly (to a certain extent and as a privilege of many)? But most importantly, the choices he worries about the users making, are not as light as they appear on the interface. Abundance does reduce the understanding but it’s not an absolute image. I still carry the burden of making the right choices that do not come from the internet, but from capital’s pressure to survive.<br><br>

            <span class="grey-example">
                Grey example: Some users choose in opposition to the dominant online tools (CryptPad/Etherpad instead of GoogleDoc; Jitsi over Zoom etc..).

This is doing the work of COINTELPRO in the sense that you see people calling each other out online, and you see all these rifts being created. Social media is doing that to us. Stepping back from all that is really important right now. We’re in a really critical time where all of this could actually kill the movement ...

It’s not like we are free in the public sphere/on streets either.

For many critics and academics, such a notion became a convenient basis for dismissing the possibility of revolt or militancy as outdated and unfashionable. Now, the internet complex, with all its tools for individual advancement and branding, is the new, self- serving delusion of the “meshes of power” from which use of ever-changing social media platforms can masquerade as opposition or resistance.”

It’s also a disclosure of the deeper-rooted, colonizing premise that the poor regions of the periphery desire and welcome the adoption of Western technology, including social media, and that they will necessarily benefit from its implantation. For political theorist Samir Amin, this is the legacy of Eurocentrism at its worst—that is, of capitalism putting forward a model of material abundance that is structurally impossible to achieve, and is never in fact its actual goal.”

With new objects, different addictions and passions awake, of which no one had the slightest inkling yesterday. The acquisitive drive, which is itself only acquired anyway, has grown to an extent which was quite alien to pre-capitalist times.”Our contemporary billionaire culture has its roots in nineteenth-century images of easily amassed riches and the desires these aroused, relocating hope from anything based on shared responsibilities and mutuality to an individual craving for financial and symbolic capital.”

In Patti Smith’s 1975 song, “Free Money,” her narrator longs for the gratification that the winning ticket would bring: the ability to buy the things her lover needs or wants.

For others, he failed to recognize the “playful” and creative possibilities of technology. Then, after 1991, what did it all matter anyway, since capitalism was here to stay? Notwithstanding these critiques, Marcuse allows us to see some of the continuities of the internet complex with entrenched features of capitalism that have only intensified since the 1960s. More invasive forms of technical rationality have produced what Bernard Stiegler sees as an extreme phenomenon of proletarianization. By this he means the ongoing colonization of consciousness, the homogenization of experience, and the anesthetization of the senses.

                        What is community then? Community can also be a passive experience; if you’re on streets just being in the community (or a protest). Partaking in community and partaking in building technology with a goal to build community is a better outlook.

                    “We often assume that internet “surfing” means the possibility of following random, uncharted visual itineraries but, in most instances, this is only a pseudo- wandering that is, in fact, tracing a predictable sequence of fixation points interspersed with habitual patterns of scrolling and clicking. Like the phrase “to navigate a website,” surfing connotes an open, aqueous milieu, but the reality is repetitive itineraries devoid of actual drift or waywardness. From the standpoint of the bored individual, hours spent in this way may seem to be a desultory waste of time, but it is time occupied in a contemporary mode of informal work that produces value as marketable information for corporate and institutional interests. The eye (and mind) is discouraged from being errant and the observer is prevented from getting lost, or from evading requisite visual tasks.”

        <h3>TWO OUT OF FIVE STARS</h3>
        Throughout the book, I kept thinking about the references he used and they’re all good (Bernard Stiegler, Franco Bifo Berardi, Hannah Arendt, Henri Lefevbre, Guy Debord, Simone Weil even!! But mostly men — I was surprised that Ayn Rand was missing) but somehow used them for the reader’s emotional blackmailing. He just rapped out their names; I was like uuuuu he’s gonna get me with this one, but he just used them to strengthen his point, not to reflect on them.<br><br> 
        <span class="underline">Example:</span><br>
        “The philosopher Simone Weil, writing in 1943 several months before her death, identified a spiritual crisis of “uprootedness” as one of the most injurious consequences of world war and the dominance of a money economy. Her account has nothing in common with reactionary appeals to land and soil; for her, to be uprooted was to be denied “real, active and natural participation in the life of a community.”51 She emphasized that one can remain geographically stationary and yet become torn away from a shared connection to the past or mutually nurtured expectations for the future. No matter one’s environment, whether urban or rural, Weil elaborated on the necessity of having multiple roots in it, roots that engage one practically through work and morally through attentiveness to others. In our present moment, all the new forms of digital uprootedness support the illusion of autonomy, while any vague longings for enduring emotional connections are thwarted by the transience and homogeneity of online interactions. Inevitably, this reinforces our uncomprehending indifference to the unraveling of the lifeworld around us. We become blind to the mounting uprootings of a different kind, merciless and terrifying, which are on course to shatter our techno-complacency. Famine, drought, and warfare continue to force millions from their homes and once-functioning communities, leaving behind lands and whole regions that can no longer support life. By casting our lot in with the “becoming digital” of everything, we drift in the hallucination that it will all somehow persist. In spite of our hopes and intentions, we unthinkingly perpetuate the disaster of the global present and doom ourselves to inherit the terminal tabula rasa of scorched earth capitalism.”

        Reading this book felt like reading Jonathan’s side job gig.
        <br><br>
        His concerns are legit, I just feel like abolishing internet is the tool for us to care about the technologies we are using, especially not if we’re not in this class. He is interested in geological damage as a major consequence to his discontent with technologies. But I get lost with which technologies he’s tackling into. I guess all of them, which only leads me to think that he has an absolute idea of technology, a final say, whether it’s constantly changing especially the softwares and can only be done if we stop thinking about technology as an ultimate one absolute entity. We start with simple tools. 
        <br><br>
        Overall, it’s an important read for someone who is emotionally self-aware of the sentimental traps within the book that allow for reading the material selectively. Some points are good and necessary. 
        <br><br>
        I don’t like that he doesn’t use contemporary examples of youth turning knobs, or women pressing buttons.

        <h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>He got me with general worry about pollution. I worry more about physical pollution. How do we talk pollution in LA (1 car/person + poor recycling)?</li>
            <li>Fueled by Jonathan’s sometimes constructive cynicism, can we try and build a better image of the internet? Why do we love internet? (Even if you don’t, imagine that you do)</li>
            <li>Do we understand our attention spans currently? In terms of reading, I for sure don’t have much patience for too general theories(like this one)?</li>
            <li>What is a community then??According to Dreary.</li>
            <li>“Since the mid-1990s, the internet complex has been the overarching means for not just neutralizing the insurgent energies of youth but for preventing youth from experiencing and knowing itself.” — We are that Youth? How do we feel with his sentiment? Are we dispossessed of our youth?</li>
            <li>Quoting Marcuse: “Technology provides the great rationalisation for the unfreedom of human beings and demonstrates the ‘technical’ impossibility of being autonomous, of determining one’s own life”. Here I’m wondering how does he track autonomy? Maybe it’s just untraceable by technology? And how many of us agree with this sentiment?</li>
            <li>“By design, there never will be network privacy for individuals; but we are nonetheless asked to believe that legislation to guarantee privacy may someday happen, that current abuses can be curbed, and that we can reclaim the reassuring fiction of “our” internet that in fact never existed. We are pushed further into identifying ourselves with our data, our search history, our passwords.” But do they represent who we are? All these datasets? Like a passport?</li>
