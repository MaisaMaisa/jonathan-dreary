        “But such optimistic speculation was based on a model of the workplace and on a notion of “immaterial labor” that bore little resemblance to the actual circumstances of workers as austerity measures intensified. Now, two decades later, the reality of low-wage labor using digital technology is of repetitive and physically enervating tasks, subject to harsh time-management and productivity surveillance. The prospect of “cooperative networks” or online “peer to peer” exchanges leading to effective political agency has given way to the pervasive realities of workplace isolation, despair, and the threat of disposability. Gig economy workers have little to share with each other but their destitution and exhaustion. Since the 1990s, there has been a further breakdown of separations between work time and non-work time, between public and private time, making the creation of political or civic community difficult or impossible to achieve.”

        “Some have argued that as of the 1990s, a new kind of historical awareness, often labeled “presentism,” has begun to displace the various “futurisms” of the preceding two centuries. Elements of presentism include all the technological innovations designed to abolish time or function in “real time,” which privilege the “now” and foster the illusion of instantaneity and immediate availability. That every service or product should be accessible “on demand” presupposes a reality unmoored from spatial, material, or temporal constraints. A related feature is the use of computing for risk analyses, forecasts, and simulations, seeking to identify multiple outcomes and to minimize uncertainty; in a sense, to occupy and neutralize the future before it occurs.”

        “Part of our current crisis is the indifferent acceptance of the now banalized notion that our future is being invented by a small number of powerful corporations. Decisions about what product lines will sustain profits and growth have effectively made these companies into the official futurologists of our time, the regulators of our expectations.”

        “For the managers of the new hegemon in the West, expectations of actual “peace dividends,” in whatever form, had to be quickly nullified or diverted. Thus, anticipations of a more egalitarian, non-militarized society were displaced by a future conforming to neoliberal priorities. The availability of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, framed by absurd claims about cyberspace and virtual reality, was pivotal in this operation of tranquilization. Alongside the celebration of globalization, the internet was hailed as the portal to a new age of connectedness and opportunity. And to ensure that the “peace dividend” was forgotten, the 1990s were marked by a new sequence of high-tech wars with calamitous US military interventions in Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, and Kosovo/Serbia.”

        “As this book went to press, some of the most heavily publicized areas of techno- innovation included AI, robotics, neurosciences, augmented/virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, nanotechnology, genomics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Each of these topics could be considered individually, but together they convey a sense of the suffocating occupation of a world from which human agency and creativity has been deleted. The ongoing promotion of AI, robotics, and the IoT is a forlorn announcement of the relegation of humans, as working and living beings, to the periphery of technological systems, and also, for many, into debt, hunger, illness, and impoverishment.”

        “We are currently overwhelmed from all sides by reverential exaltations of “science” and of the unimpeachable authority of “the scientists” who will deliver us from the climate crisis….Science, in its many powerful institutional manifestations, is now essentialized as an a priori source of truth, existing above economic interests or social determinations and exempt from historical or ideological evaluation.”

        “Now, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, billionaires are pursuing the transhumanist illusion that a mind can be uploaded to a computer, to attain some kind of biomechanical immortality. In the 1960s, Theodor Adorno profiled the technophile as a pathological manipulator: those who fetishize technology, he said, are “the cold ones” who have never known love, joy, or empathy. “This is not meant to be sentimental or moralistic but rather describes a deficient libidinal relation to other persons.”

        “For the elites, the priority remains: keep people enclosed within the augmented unrealities of the internet complex, where experience is fragmented into a kaleidoscope of fleeting claims of importance, of never-ending admonitions on how to conduct our lives, manage our bodies, what to buy and who to admire or to fear.”

        “A human being, he insisted, was a living “center of indetermination,” a position from which the world was perpetually changing, open to action, choice, and the possibility of freedom. Whatever minimized this indeterminacy or rendered perception habitual was an inhibition of life. Bergson was followed by many others over the next century, who sought to resist the standardization of perception and the regulation of attention required by the industrialization of labor and new visual technologies. Eye tracking is currently one part of this larger and ongoing project of colonization”

        “Eye tracking analytics are especially important in the expansive industry of user experience design, known as UXD. This rapidly expanding business sector is responsible for much of what we see online and for the narrow models of attention that are the basis for their design work. One company tells potential clients, “We’re looking to create emotional connections in our design of tax preparation and personal finance websites. If you create an experience that connects with a user on an emotional level, you’ve succeeded.” IBM, like most big corporations, does all their UXD in-house. In their “cognitive e-commerce” division, the stated goal is to build “deeper human engagement ... ”

        “William James, in his Principles of Psychology, made a concise and provisional definition: “experience is what I agree to attend to,” while UXD is the perversion of this maxim into “experience is what we tell you to attend to.””

        “The meaningful content of human speech is inseparable from its bodily performance: the rhythm of breathing, the movements of the folds and muscles of the larynx, the actions of mouth and tongue. For thousands of years, one of our primary means of understanding others has been our intuitive sensitivity to what is conveyed by these resonances and vibrations of a living voice. Now when talking to robots, we involuntarily flatten and diminish the breadth of expressiveness in our own words, and there is a withering of singularity and spontaneity in many of our other verbal interactions. An utterance is now often the equivalent of flicking an on/off switch. So what, some will reply: hasn’t language always been a praxis, a way of doing things? This retort is either naïve or cynical, because it ignores the powerful institutional and financial circuitry within which spoken words are now solicited and deployed by data-driven procedures…We acquiesce out of passivity or convenience, and over time we come to have thoughts and gestures that are no longer our own..PERSIST BY DESIGN OR NEGLECT”
